Dexter: Where's 13?
Debra: Disc 13, it was damaged. I was actually grateful I didn't have to watch another one of these.
Dexter: Have you been here all night?
Debra: Yeah. And I think it was worth it cos I think I'm starting to figure it out. I went through Cole Harmon's contacts. And do you remember that weird plastic-wrap murder a few weeks back - those two guys at the warehouse?
Dexter: Yeah, one of them was a dentist.
Debra: A kids' dentist. Dan Mendell. Well, it turns out he and Cole are buddies. They fucking poke each other on Facebook. And you see that ring on the DVD? It matches photos taken at the warehouse crime scene. So, I think he's one of these guys. So, Dan the dentist is dead. He was shot to death. Looks like somebody attacked Cole Harmon in his house. And Boyd Fowler's disappeared. This is a group of guys that like to get together and they like to do this for fun. So, what else do they have in common? They're all missing. But they're not on the run, I can tell you that. Not one of them bought a plane ticket, or emptied their bank account or used a fucking credit card. Someone is taking these guys out.
Dexter: Who?
Debra: Well, at first I thought they were turning on each other. Then I thought, "That doesn't make sense. Why would they do that after all this time?" So, I started asking myself, "Who would want to take these guys out?" And you know the first person that came to mind? Me.
Dexter: You?
Debra: Someone who knows what these cocksuckers have been up to and wants to give them what they deserve.
Dexter: So, what are you saying? There's a vigilante out there?
Debra: Yeah, I think that's what I'm saying. Yes.

Dexter: [Voiceover: I guess it's fitting that I end up where I've left so many others. I only wonder if the world is going to be a better place without me. It's wrong what people say about dying. I'm not flashing back over my life, over the lives I've taken. I'm thinking about the life I'll miss. Harrison. I'll miss watching my son grow up.]

Debra: You were right.
Dr Ross: Debra, we can schedule a time...
Debra: I told him. I fucking told my brother that I love him, and he said "I love you" back. Not, "Me too," or something like that. He actually said "I love you."
Dr Ross: Wow. That's big, isn't it?
Debra: Yeah, I mean, I don't think he understood that I'm in love with him, but still, he said the actual words for the first time.
Dr Ross: So what do you think it means?
Debra: I don't know what the fuck it means. That's why I'm here. Is this just...horribly wrong?
Dr Ross: Does it feel wrong?
Debra: It makes...my whole life...every man I've ever loved, make sense. It's like I've always been looking for someone like Dexter or someone who's the opposite of Dexter as a way to avoid the fact that I'm in love with him. That's just clear to me now, and I want it to be clear to him. I want him to understand.
Dr Ross: OK. You want to tell him what you feel in a way that he can hear you.
Debra: Yes. Is this how it feels to be in control of your emotions?
Dr Ross: But you can't control his. You don't know how he's going to react.

Dexter: This is the way the world ends. Your world, anyway...
Travis: No! No, no! I'm supposed to finish enacting the seven keys.
Dexter: Sorry.
Travis: But I was chosen! I was chosen to bring about the new world.
Dexter: Chosen to kill innocent people?
Travis: No one is innocent.
Dexter: My son is. You tried to kill him.
Travis: God allowed his son to die.
Dexter: How could you believe in that?
Travis: Because I walk the path of the righteous.
Dexter: I've known people who believed in God. They would never use their faith as a convenient excuse to kill 10 people. You used God. It's not the other way around.
Travis: You... You are a shining example of how putrid man has become.
Dexter: I am a father, a son, a serial killer.
Travis: You're going to burn in hell.
Dexter: No, I think I belong right here. Because maybe there is a place for me in this world - just as I am. Light cannot exist without darkness. Each has its purpose. And if there is a purpose to my darkness, maybe it's to bring some...balance to this world. Because, let's face it, the world is going to be a better place without you.
Travis: The world is going to end. And when it does, I will be by God's side.
Dexter: You sure?
Travis: Yes.
Dexter: Good for you.
Travis: You're mocking me.
Dexter: No, I almost envy you. It must be nice to be so certain.
Travis: You're wrong about everything because you don't believe in God, but I have faith. I trust in God's plan.
Dexter: Really? Then it must be God's plan that you're on my table. Do you think it's God's will that I'm about to kill you? God has nothing to do with this! You are wrapped in plastic because I want to kill you.
Travis: This is not how it's supposed to be!
Dexter: Maybe this is exactly how it's supposed to be. Maybe everything is exactly as it should be.
