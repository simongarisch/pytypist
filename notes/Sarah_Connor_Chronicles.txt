Our identities change. Our names, the way we look, how we act and speak. We're shape-shifters.

Derek Reese: Some people, you can beat them and beat them, and they'll take it. Whatever pain you give them, They absorb it, Like it was theirs all along, and all you're doing is giving it back to them. You see, deep down, they hate themselves, and they use that hate to eat the pain. See, we were all good once; we all loved ourselves once.

They tried to kill my mom before I was even born. When I was twelve they sent one after me. I was a kid and I was stupid. I didn't know what it was all about. Both times future me sent someone back to stop them. The first time it was a soldier. His name was Kyle Reese, and he died saving my mother's life. The second time it was a machine, and I used to wonder why I did that. Why I took that chance. I don't wonder anymore. Human beings can't be replaced. They can't be rebuilt. They die and they never come back. You know, it was Derek who told me, if that's what you're wondering. He loves you, Derek. You and me, we're the only things he has in this world. The only things. He's like Riley in that way. See, she made mistakes. Small things, sometimes. A word or a phrase. Carrots and apples. I'm guessing that's yours. When we were in Mexico she heard my real name, she ignored it. A man took my picture and she destroyed his camera. She put herself between me and a machine that was hunting me. So one day I realized she wasn't treating me like John Baum, she was treating me like John Connor.

Jesse: She wanted to tell you.

I couldn't figure out why she would tell the school counselor, or go to DCFS. She didn't, did she? I only understood after I saw how you'd hurt her. That's when I knew what you tried to do and how it went wrong.
Jesse: You saw her. I'm sorry.

John Henry: The human brain is an amazing computer. Its raw clock speed is 20 billion calculations per second. Its storage is functionally infinite. But it's flawed.
James Ellison: How's that?
John Henry: There's no way to download it when you die.
James Ellison: Not exactly, no.
John Henry: Your Bible solves this problem by introducing a concept of Heaven.
James Ellison: Yes.
John Henry: Billions of souls with no bodies.
James Ellison: Okay.
John Henry: [Gesturing towards his server farm] Yet all this required simply to process the unique entity you call John Henry.
James Ellison: Yes.
John Henry: It's possible the Heaven has a hardware problem.
James Ellison: It's not that simple.
John Henry: I need to know what my brother is thinking, Mr. Ellison. I need to know what he plans to do. I don't want to die again.

John Connor: I want to tell you something.
Cameron: Yes?
John Connor: It was not my idea to ditch you and Derek. I thought we were going to meet you in the desert and my mom took this detour off to Charlie's. I thought you knew.
Cameron: She had her reasons.
John Connor: She was pretty damn pissed at Derek about the whole Jesse thing. Who wasn't? I guess none of that matters now.
Cameron: You'll miss him.
John Connor: Well, there's no use crying out it, is there? I'm sure future me would beat my ass if I did.
Cameron: Future you knows what it means to lose people you love. It happens to him, too. Your mother ditched us because she was going to ditch you. She was going to leave you with Charlie.
John Connor: No. No, that's insane.
Cameron: She found a lump in her breast.
John Connor: Yeah, a transmitter. I know.
Cameron: She thought it was cancer.
John Connor: Well she had a lump. It makes sense.

John Connor: What does he do there?
Savannah Weaver: He lives in the basement.

Savannah Weaver: He's real. He talks. I'm teaching him how to sing.
John Connor: Why does he live in the basement then?
Savannah Weaver: He can't leave. There's a cord in the back of his head.
John Connor: A cord?
Savannah Weaver: In the back of his head.
John Connor: Do other people talk to John Henry?
Savannah Weaver: Mr. Ellison.

John Connor: I don't think it's Cromartie. I think it's something else. Something bigger. Something worse.
Sarah Connor: Cyberdyne all over again.
John Connor: Why did they need the body?
Cameron: The technology can be reversed engineered and used as a platform.
John Connor: Yeah I know all that. But they're not using it for the parts. They're... playing with it.
Cameron: [referring to James Ellison] I should've killed him. I'm going to kill him.
Sarah Connor: You're not going to kill him.

Sarah Connor: No one can be trusted.
