Shane Walsh: Never met a woman who knew how to turn off a light. Born thinkin' the switch only goes one way, On.
Shane Walsh: [Begins to say things be then keeps changing his mind]
Shane Walsh: Come home, house all lit up, and my job, you see, apparently because my chromosomes happen to be different is that I gotta walk through that house and turn off every single light this chick left on.
Rick Grimes: Is that right?
Shane Walsh: Yeah, baby. Oh Reverend Shane is preachin' to ya now, boy. Then this same chick, mind ya, she'll bitch about, uh, Global Warming. This is where Reverend Shane wants to quote from the Guy Gospel and say, "Uh, darlin' maybe if you and every other pair of boobs on this planet could just figure out that the light switch, see, goes both ways, maybe we wouldn't have so much Global Warming?"
Rick Grimes: You say that?
Shane Walsh: The pull-out version. Still, that earns me this look of loathing you would not believe and that's when the Exorcist voice pops out "You sound just like my damn Father! Always yellin' about the power bill and tellin' me to turn off the damn lights!"

Well, I guess if this is the first you're hearing it, I know how it must sound... But listen, one thing I do know - don't you get bit. I saw your bandage and that's what we were afraid of.

Rick Grimes: Dale coud - could get under your skin. He sure got under mine, because he wasn't afraid to say what he thought, how he felt. That kind of honest is rare and brave. Whenever I'd make a decision, I'd look at Dale. He'd be looking back at me with that look he had. We've all seen it one time or another. I couldn't always read him, but he could read us. He saw people for who they were. He knew things about us - the truth who we really are. In the end, he was talking about losing our humanity. He said this group was broken. The best way to honor him is to unbreak it. Set aside our differences and pull together, stop feeling sorry for ourselves and take control of our lives... our safety... our future. We're not broken. We're gonna prove him wrong. From now on... we're gonna do it his way. That is how we honor Dale.

Rick Grimes: We gotta keep moving. There have been Walkers crawling all over here.
T-Dog: I say head east.

Rick Grimes: We're all infected.
Daryl Dixon: What?
Rick Grimes: At the C.D.C., Jenner told me. Whatever it is, we all carry it.
Carol Peletier: And you never said anything?
Rick Grimes: Would it have made a difference?
Glenn: You knew this whole time?
Rick Grimes: How could I have known for sure? You saw how crazy that mo...
Glenn: That is not your call. Okay, when I found about the Walkers in the barn, I told, for the good of everyone.
Rick Grimes: Well, I thought it best that people didn't know.

Rick Grimes: I killed him. I killed Shane. He came at me. He killed Randall to get me in the woods. He planned it. I had - I had no choice. I gave him every chance... and he kept leading me further out. He pushed me, and I let him. After awhile, I knew - I knew what he was doing, what he was up to. And I kept going. I didn't stop. I could have, but... I just wanted it over. Dogging me every step of the way. Acting like I stole you and Carl, like... like I was in the way. I just wanted it over. I wanted him dead. I killed him. He turned. That's how I knew Jenner - Jenner was right. Carl put him down.
