    bring me back my little brother, goddamn it! 
	Ready, Ike? Kick the baby! 
	Yes, at first I was happy to be learning how to read. 
	It seemed exciting and magical, but then I read this: 
	Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of its garbage, 
	and because of this piece of shoot, I'm never reading again. 
	Dude, Cartman, look! Your mom is on the cover of Crack Whore magazine! 
	Yeah. We're guys, dude. 
	We find something about all our friends to rip on. 
	We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy. 
	Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew. 
	Right. 
	And Stan for being in love with Wendy. 
	And Cartman for being fat. 
	And Cartman for being stupid. 
	And Cartman for having a whore for a mom. 
	And Cartman for being a sadistic asshole. 
	Ey, you did me already!
