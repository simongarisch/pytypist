    Your mother's been worried sick and I've been watching TV. 
	I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six. 
	It's called a tasting and it's classy. 
	Stanley, call your friend an asshole this instant. 
	What seems to be the officer, problem? 
	Stan can you get me a beer? Stan? 
	Oh, you're all not getting it, see, while we're at it, 
	we'll have a balloon instead of a ball, 
	and whoever catches the ballon tries to run 
	while all the other players hug! 
	Well, we had Stan and his friends play with a 
	kid who already had chickenpox so they could catch it. 
	Trust me, I'm a Geologist.
