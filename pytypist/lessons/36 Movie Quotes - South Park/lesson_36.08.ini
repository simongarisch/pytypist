    Skylarkings? You know, tomfooleries. Who? 
	Right now, you're nuttier than Chinese chicken salad, mmmkay. 
	I mean, you're one screwed up little kid, do you understand? 
	But you know, if you have completely lost your sense of humor, 
	you can always become a writer for the show, Friends. 
	Well, what did you used to think was funny? 
	You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies. 
	This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and I couldn't laugh. 
	I mean I, I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.
