content = Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. 
    for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, Linux, and z/OS. 
	Swift is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the large body of existing Objective-C code written for Apple products. 
	Swift was introduced at Apple's 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). 
	It underwent an upgrade to version 1.2 during 2014 and a more major upgrade to Swift 2 at WWDC 2015. 
	Initially a proprietary language, version 2.2 was made open-source software under the Apache License 2.0 on December 3, 2015, 
	for Apple's platforms and Linux. 
	Development of Swift started in July 2010 by Chris Lattner, with the eventual collaboration of many other programmers at Apple. 
	Swift took language ideas "from Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C#, CLU, and far too many others to list". 
	The Swift Programming Language, a free 500-page manual, was also released at WWDC, and is available on the iBooks Store and the official website.
