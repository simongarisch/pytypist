content = C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". 
    The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ has object-oriented, generic, 
	and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. 
	C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, 
	with performance, efficiencyÂ¸ and flexibility of use as its design highlights. 
	C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, 
	including desktop applications, servers and performance-critical applications. 
	C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), 
	with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 (informally known as C++17). 
	In 1982, Stroustrup started to develop a successor to C with Classes, which he named C++ (++ being the increment operator in C) 
	after going through several other names.
