content = Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed 
    for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), 
	or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). 
	It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables. 
	Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, 
	SQL consists of many types of statements, which may be informally classed as sublanguages, 
	commonly: a data query language (DQL), a data definition language (DDL), 
	a data control language (DCL), and a data manipulation language (DML). 
	The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update and delete), 
	data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control. 
	SQL was initially developed at IBM by Donald Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce after learning about 
	the relational model from Ted Codd in the early 1970s. 
	This version, initially called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), 
	was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM's original quasi-relational database management system, System R.
