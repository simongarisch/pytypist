content = JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. 
    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. 
	JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. 
	The vast majority of websites use it, and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it. 
	Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, 
	including server-side in web servers and databases. 
	Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, 
	and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design. 
	JavaScript was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.
