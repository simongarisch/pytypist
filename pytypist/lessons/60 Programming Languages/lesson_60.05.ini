content = C# (pronounced see sharp) was developed around 2000 by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative, 
    and later approved as an international standard by Ecma and ISO. 
	Mono is the name of the free and open-source project to develop a compiler and runtime for the language. 
	C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI). 
    The name "C sharp" was inspired by the musical notation where a sharp indicates that the written note should be made a semitone higher in pitch. 
    James Gosling, who created the Java programming language in 1994, and Bill Joy, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems, 
	the originator of Java, called C# an "imitation" of Java; Gosling further said that "C# is sort of Java with reliability, productivity and security deleted." 
    Since the release of C# 2.0 in November 2005, the C# and Java languages have evolved on increasingly divergent trajectories, becoming two very different languages.
