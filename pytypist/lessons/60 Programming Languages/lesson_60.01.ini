content = Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
    It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), 
	meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. 
	Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
	As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, 
	particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. 
	Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) 
	and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems Java platform. 
	James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. 
	Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time. 
	The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, 
	from Java coffee. Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.
