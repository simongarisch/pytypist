content = Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. 
    Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.
	The language is often referred to as "Golang" because of its domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go.
	Go was designed at Google in 2007 to improve programming productivity in an era of multicore, networked machines and large codebases.
	The designers wanted to address criticism of other languages in use at Google, but keep their useful characteristics.
	Go is widely used in production at Google and in many other organizations and open-source projects.
	Go 1 guarantees compatibility for the language specification and major parts of the standard library.
	All versions up to the current Go 1.12 release have maintained this promise.
