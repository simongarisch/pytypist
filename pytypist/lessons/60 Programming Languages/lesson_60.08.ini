content = PHP is a general-purpose programming language originally designed for web development. 
    It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994; the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. 
	PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. 
	PHP code may be executed with a command line interface (CLI), embedded into HTML code, 
	or used in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks. 
	PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in a web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. 
	PHP development began in 1994 when Rasmus Lerdorf wrote several Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs in C, 
	which he used to maintain his personal homepage. 
	He extended them to work with web forms and to communicate with databases, and called this implementation "Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter" or PHP/FI.
