content = C (as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, 
    lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations. 
	C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix. 
	Later, it was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. 
	During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages, 
	with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. 
	C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 (see ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization. 
	In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the first edition of The C Programming Language. 
	This book, known to C programmers as K&R, served for many years as an informal specification of the language. 
	The version of C that it describes is commonly referred to as "K&R C". 
	The second edition of the book covers the later ANSI C standard.
