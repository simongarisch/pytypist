content = VB.NET is a multi-paradigm, object-oriented programming language, implemented on the .NET Framework. 
    Microsoft launched VB.NET in 2002 as the successor to its original Visual Basic language. 
	C# and Visual Basic .NET are Microsoft's first languages made to program on the .NET Framework 
	(later adding F# and more and others have also added languages). 
	Though C# and VB.NET are syntactically different, that is where the differences mostly end. 
	Microsoft developed both of these languages to be part of the same .NET Framework development platform. 
	The creation of open-source tools for VB.NET development has been slow compared to C#.
