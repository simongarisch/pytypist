content = Check it out man, that's uh 14 mounted toms, 8 floor toms, 4 splashes, 
    2 gongs, 10 cowbells , 4 rides, 5 snares, a rototom rack, and it's all mounted 
	on my infamous quadruple kick drum system. 
	Six more pieces and I got a bigger set than Neil Peart from Rush, yeah. 
	Teachers want us to work, and I say, "Fine, I'll work. But you've gotta let me do the kind of work that I wanna do." 
	And for me, it's my drum kit, man. This is my passion. 
	This is the essence of who I am now. 
	But before I had this, I was lost, too. 
	You see what I'm saying? 
	You need to find your reason for living. 
	You've gotta find your big, gigantic drum kit.
