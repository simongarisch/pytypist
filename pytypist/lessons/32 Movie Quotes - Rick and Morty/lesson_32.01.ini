	All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. 
	I know that new situations can be intimidating. 
	You're lookin' around, and it's all scary and different, but y'know... 
	meeting them head-on, charging into 'em like a bull

	We're gonna die!!! We're gonna die, Morty!!!
    The outside world is our enemy, Morty! 
	We're the only friends we got, Morty! 
	It's just Rick and Morty! 
	Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty! 
	Rick and Morty forever and forever, 100 years, 
	Rick and Morty's things!
