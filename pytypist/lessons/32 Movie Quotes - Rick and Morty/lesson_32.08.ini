content = The division I see is between the Ricks and Mortys 
    that like the Citadel divided, and the rest of us. 
	I see it everywhere I go. I see it in our schools, 
	where they teach Mortys we're all the same because they're 
	threatened by what makes us unique. I see it in our streets, 
	where they give guns to Mortys so we're too busy fighting 
	each other to fight real injustice. I see it in our factories, 
	where Ricks work for a fraction of their boss's salary even 
	though they're identical and have the same IQ. 
	The Citadel's problem isn't homeless Mortys or outraged Ricks, 
	the Citadel's problem is the Ricks and Mortys feeding on the 
	Citadel's death. But I've got a message for them, from the 
	Ricks and Mortys keeping it alive. 
	A message from the Ricks and Mortys that believe in this 
	Citadel to the Ricks and Mortys that don't: You're outnumbered!
