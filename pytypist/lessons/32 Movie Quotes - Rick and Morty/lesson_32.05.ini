    You're a good kid. And there's not a premium on that right now, 
	but you'll be getting girls sometime after Brad's out of shape. 
	My marriage is FINE, thank you. 
	All this time, you've been thinking, 
	"What if that loser Jerry hadn't talked me out of the abortion?" 
	Well, now you know, you'd be a doctor. Whoop-dee-doo. 
	You'd also be drinking wine, alone in a house full of exotic birds. 
	And I'd be on DiCaprio's yacht, banging Kristen Stewart! 
	Wow, that's humbling and flattering, son. Thank you. 
	What's say we finish ourselves an 8-planet solar system? 
	Yes, I will! That's right, assholes! Take my penis. Take it all!! 
	And tell Shrimply Pibbles that when the galaxy came calling, 
	Jerry Smith from Earth didn't flinch!
