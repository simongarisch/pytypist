content = Because I don't respect therapy. Because I'm a scientist. 
    Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, 
	and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. 
	And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to 
	listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean 
	which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything. 
	I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, 
	which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, 
	but not something I want for myself. 
	I'm not a cow. I'm a pickle. When I feel like it. So... you asked.
