content = Grandpa Rick! Can you help me with my science homework?
    No you don't. You're the little brother. You're not the cause 
	of your parents' misery, you're just a symptom of it. 
	Thanks. Tiny Rick, you think you might be getting back into your old body tonight? 
	Okay, but if not tonight, when?
	Look at his art, Morty!
	Why does it say "Help me Morty and Summer!"?!
	Grandpa, I think that when you put your mind into this body's young brain, 
	it did what young brains doâ€”it shoved the bad thoughts into the back and 
	put a large wall around them. But those bad thoughts are the real Rick. 
	The fact that you're old, the fact that we're all going to die one day, 
	the fact that the universe is so big, nothing in it matters - 
	those facts are who you are! 
	So you're trapped in there and you can only come out in the form of Tiny Rick's teen angst!
