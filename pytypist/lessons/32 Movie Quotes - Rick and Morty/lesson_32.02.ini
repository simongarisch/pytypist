content = Geez, Rick. In the time it took you to make this thing, 
    couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?
	On one of our adventures, Rick and I basically destroyed the 
	whole world. So we bailed on that reality and we came to this one. 
	Because in this one, the world wasn't destroyed. And in this one, 
	we were dead. So we came here, a-an-an-and we buried ourselves 
	and we took their place. And every morning, Summer, 
	I eat breakfast 20 yards away from my own rotting corpse! 
	You have a whole planet... sitting around making your power for you?! 
	That's slavery! That just sounds like slavery with extra steps!
