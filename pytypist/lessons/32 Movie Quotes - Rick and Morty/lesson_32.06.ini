content = Look, I think we've all had a tough wedding. 
    Actually, the wedding was beautiful. The reception got out of hand. 
	Anyway, I say we go home, sleep it off, and have a family meeting in the morning. 
	Jerry, so help me God, if you ever bring this up again, no more bacon! 
	Dad, I would like you to tell me what's in the syringe. 
	Are you saying Tommy survived here by having sex with Froopy creatures, 
	creating Froopy-human hybrid offspring and then consuming their proteins, 
	sustaining himself with an endless cycle of cannibalistic incest? 
	If nothing matters, why would you do that for me? 
	I don't know, maybe you matter so little that I like you. 
	Or maybe it makes you matter. Maybe I love you. Maybe something about your mother. 
	Don't jump a gift shark in the mouth.
