    Where are my testicles, Summer? They were removed. Where have they gone? 
	Do not call me that! "Snuffles" was my slave name. 
	You shall now call me Snowball, because my fur is pretty and white.
	Scaring you? Tell me, Summer. If a human was born with stumpy legs, 
	would they breed it with another deformed human and put their 
	children on display like the Dachshund?
	Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again?
	You will walk when it is time to walk.
