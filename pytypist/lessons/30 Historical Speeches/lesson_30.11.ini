content = If we want to resist the powers which threaten to supress intellectual 
    and individual freedom we must keep clearly before us what is at stake, 
	and what we owe to that freedom which our ancestors have won for us after hard struggles. 
	Without such freedom there would have been no Shakespeare, no Goethe, no Newton, no Faraday, 
	no Pasteur and no Lister. There would be no comfortable houses for the mass of people, no railway, 
	no wireless, no protection against epidemics, no cheap books, 
	no culture and no enjoyment of art at all. 
	There would be no machines to relieve the people from the arduous labour needed for the 
	production of the essential necessities of life. 
	Most people would lead a dull life of slavery just as under the ancient despotisms of Asia. 
	It is only men who are free, who create the inventions and intellectual works which to us 
	moderns make life worth while.
