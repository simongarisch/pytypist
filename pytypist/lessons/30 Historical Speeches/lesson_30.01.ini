content = During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. 
    I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. 
	I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live 
	together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live 
	for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.
