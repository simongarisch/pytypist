    To you I turn, my friends. 
	The treacherous military attack by Hitler-Germany on our motherland, 
	which was launched on June 22nd continues. 
	Despite heroic resistance by the Red Army and although the best divisions 
	of the enemy and his best air force units have already been destroyed 
	and have met their end on the battlefields, the enemy continues to advance 
	and throws new troops into battle. Hitler's forces have succeeded in conquering Lithuania, 
	a considerable part of Latvia, the western part of Byelorussia and part of western Ukraine. 
	The Fascist air force expands the range of its bombers and subjects Murmansk, Orsha, Mogilyow, 
	Smolensk, Kiev, Odessa and Sevastopol to bombardments. A serious danger hangs over our motherland. 
    How could it occur that our illustrious Red Army has surrendered a few towns and regions to the Fascist armies? 
	Are the German-Fascist troops really as invincible as the bragging Fascist propagandamachine is relentlessly broadcasting? 
	Of course not! History shows that invincible armies do not exist and have never existed. 
	The army of Napoleon was thought to be invincible and yet it was defeated by respectively Russian, 
	English and German troops. The German army of Kaiser Wilhelm was also considered invincible during the First Imperial War, 
	yet it was defeated more than once by Russian and Anglo-French troops and ultimately destroyed by Anglo-French armies. 
	The same should be said about the present Fascist German army of Hitler. 
	This army has not yet faced any opposition worth speaking of on the continent of Europe. 
	Only on our territory it has met noticable opposition. 
	If as a result of this opposition the best divisions of the Fascist German army are defeated by the Red Army, 
	then it means that Hitler's Fascist army can just as well be defeated and will be defeated just like the armies 
	of Napoleon and Wilhelm were defeated.
