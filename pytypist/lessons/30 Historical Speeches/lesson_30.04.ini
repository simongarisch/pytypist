content = But even more than that, Alan deserves recognition for his contribution to humankind.
    For those of us born after 1945, into a Europe which is united, democratic and at peace, 
	it is hard to imagine that our continent was once the theatre of mankind's darkest hour. 
	It is difficult to believe that in living memory, people could become so consumed by hate - 
	by anti-Semitism, by homophobia, by xenophobia and other murderous prejudices - 
	that the gas chambers and crematoria became a piece of European landscape as surely as 
	the galleries and universities and concert halls which had marked out the European 
	civilisation for hundreds of years. It is thanks to men and women who were totally 
	committed to fighting fascism, people like Alan Turing, that the horrors of the 
	Holocaust and of total war are part of Europe's history and not Europe's present. 
	So on behalf of the British government, and all those who live freely thanks to Alan's 
	work, I am very proud to say: we're sorry. You deserved so much better.
