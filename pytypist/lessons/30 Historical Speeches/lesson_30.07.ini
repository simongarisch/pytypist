content = Some one will say: Yes, Socrates, 
    but cannot you hold your tongue, 
	and then you may go into a foreign city, 
	and no one will interfere with you? 
	Now I have great difficulty in making you 
	understand my answer to this. 
	For if I tell you that to do as you say would 
	be a disobedience to the God, 
	and therefore that I cannot hold my tongue, 
	you will not believe that I am serious; 
	and if I say again that daily to discourse about virtue, 
	and of those other things about which you hear me 
	examining myself and others, 
	is the greatest good of man, and that the unexamined life 
	is not worth living, you are still less likely to believe me.
