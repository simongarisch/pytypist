content = I am certain that my fellow Americans expect 
    that on my induction into the Presidency I will 
	address them with a candor and a decision which 
	the present situation of our people impel. 
	This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, 
	the whole truth, frankly and boldly. 
	Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions 
	in our country today. This great Nation will endure 
	as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. 
	So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that 
	the only thing we have to fear is fear itselfâ€”nameless, 
	unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes 
	needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. 
	In every dark hour of our national life a leadership 
	of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding 
	and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. 
	I am convinced that you will again give that 
	support to leadership in these critical days.
