    and he's still hitting on me!
	Double-douche! You are not allowed to talk about anyone I date as long as 
	you're seeing Little Miss "Pardon My Tits". I'm sorry, Dex, but she is gross. 
	And pale, and nobody is pale in Miami. She is obviously a vampire. 
	A gross, English, titty vampire.
	Dexter, I've been thinking a lot about Rita. About how she died. 
	She died because of you. Because you were selfish. You have a son. 
	Harrison is three years old. Someone needs to protect him.
    Well, at first I thought they were turning on each other. 
	Then I thought, "That doesn't make sense. 
	Why would they do that after all this time?" 
	So, I started asking myself, "Who would want to take these guys out?" 
	And you know the first person that came to mind? Me.
