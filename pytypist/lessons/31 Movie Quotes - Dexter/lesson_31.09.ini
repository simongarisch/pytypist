content = If I didn't take that money, it would just sit inside a locker until some 
    fat ass who sits behind a desk grabs it to buy a new carpet for his office which

	I've got, and I can't even afford a payment on a condo.
	His wife just died. He's submitting a lab report. Seriously, the next door neighbor, 
	the guy with the, you know, forehead? He was more torn up about Rita than Dexter was.
	Look, if this were anyone but Dexter, we'd at least be thinking like detectives. 
	Which means what? What do you always say? When the wife is dead, 
	90%% of the time the husband did it.
