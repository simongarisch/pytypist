    and just ... walk right through it.
    Let me ask you a question, hypothetical. Say a newly married person... 
	accidentally discovers that his or her new spouse has a savings account with 
	a lot of money. Is that something that one should expect to share?
	But honestly, when you really get down to it, it's all about faith. 
	It's something you feel, not something you can explain. 
	This is very hard to put into words.
