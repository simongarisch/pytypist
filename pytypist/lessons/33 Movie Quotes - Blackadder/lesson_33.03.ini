    Well, go to Spain. There are millions of them. 
	It's the latest fashion, actually. And as a matter of fact, it makes me look rather sexy! 
	To another plate-swallowing bird, perhaps. If it was blind and hadn't had it in months. 
	How could you possibly know that, Blackadder? It's classified information! 
	It's the same plan that we used last time and the seventeen times before that. 
	May it please the court, as this is clearly an open and shut case,

	Ah, not all that good, Blackadder. Rather thought I'd get through the whole show. 
	Go back to working at Pratt and Sons. Keep wicket for the Croydon Gentlemen. 
	Marry Doris. Made a note in my diary on the way here. Simply says... "Bugger".
