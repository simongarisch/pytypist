content = Because Percy, far from being a fit consort for a prince of the realm, 
    you would bore the leggings off a village idiot. 
	You ride a horse rather less well than another horse would. 
	Your brain would make a grain of sand look large and ungainly. 
	And the part of you that can't be mentioned, 
	I am reliably informed by women around the court, 
	wouldn't be worth mentioning even if it could be. 
	If you put on a floppy hat and a furry cod-piece, 
	you might just get by as a fool, 
	but since you wouldn't know a joke if it got up and gave you a haircut, I doubt it. 
	That is why you are dismissed. 
	No, just a wild stab in the dark - which, incidentally, 
	is what you'll be getting if you don't start being a bit more helpful! Do you know where she lives? 
	You're a one, aren't you?! When you should be whispering sweet conversational nothings 
	like "Goodness, something twice the size of the Royal Barge has just hoved into view between the sheets", 
	you don't say a word. But enter the Creature from the Black Latrine, and you won't stop jabbering! 
	You fiend! Never have I encountered such corrupt and foul-minded perversity! 
	Have you ever considered a career in the church?! 
	No, I could never get used to the underwear. 
	That's hardly surprising. Your breath comes straight from Satan's bottom, Baldrick. 
	The only sort of mouse you're likely to catch is one without a nose. 
	Oh, come on, Baldrick, you're going to be an MP, for God's sake! 
	Look, I'll just put "Fraud and sexual deviancy". Now, minimum bribe level? 
	Yes, it's not the only thing around here that's "very small indeed". 
	Your brain, for example. Is so minute, Baldrick, that if a hungry cannibal 
	cracked your head open, there wouldn't be enough to cover a small water biscuit.
