content = In short, a German spy is giving away every one of our battle plans. 
    You look surprised, Blackadder. 
	I certainly am, sir. I didn't realise that we had any battle plans. 
	Well of course we have! How else do you think the battles are directed?! 
	Our battles are directed, sir? 
	Well of course they are, Blackadder, directed according to the grand plan. 
	Would that be the plan to continue with total slaughter until everyone's dead 
	except for Field Marshall Haig, Lady Haig and their tortoise, Alan? 
	Great Scott! Even you know it!
