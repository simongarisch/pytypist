content = No sir, the news! The Russian Revolution has started! The masses have risen up and shot all their nobs! 
    Well, hurrah! Well, we soon saw them off, didn't we?! Miserable, slant-eyed sausage-eating swine! 
	The Russians are on our side, George. 
	Are they? Oh. 
	And they've abandoned the Eastern Front. 
	The point is that now that the Russians have made peace with the Kaiser, 
	at this very moment a quarter of a million Germans are leaving the Russian Front 
	and coming here with the express purpose of using my nipples for target practice! 
	Sir...I'm scared, sir. 
	I'm the last of the tiddly-winking leap-froggers from the golden summer of 1914. 
	I don't want to die... I'm really not overly keen on dying at all, sir.
