    For the good of all mankind, never allow curiosity to lead you to open your trousers. Nothing of interest lies therein!  
    You know how they say that somewhere there's a bullet with your name on it? 
	Well, I thought that if I owned the bullet with my name on it, I'll never get hit by it! Cause I'll never shoot myself... 
	and the chances of there being two bullets with my name are very small indeed! 
	Maybe... the war's over. Maybe it's peace! 
	Thank God! We lived through it! The Great War, 1914 to 1917! 
	I'm afraid... not. The guns have stopped because we're about to attack. 
	Not even our generals are mad enough to shell their own men. 
	They think it's far more sporting to let the Germans do it. 
	Oh, there's a nasty splinter on that ladder, sir! A bloke could hurt himself on that!
