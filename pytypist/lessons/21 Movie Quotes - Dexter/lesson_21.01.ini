content = I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask ... 
    not just me. People think it's fun to pretend you're a monster. 
	Me, I spend my life pretending I'm not. Brother, friend, boyfriend - 
	all part of my costume collection. Some people might call me a fraud. 
	Let's see if it will fit. I prefer to think of myself as a master of disguise.
    The FBI estimates that there are less that 50 serial killers active in the 
	United States today. We don't get together at conventions, share trade secrets, 
	or exchange Christmas cards ... but sometimes I wonder what it's like for the others.
	It was me. The idea of a code was one thing, a grand idea, a noble cause. 
	But the reality of it ... Harry walked in on what he created. 
	And he couldn't live with himself.
