content = The combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP), often referred to as the birth control pill or colloquially as "the pill", 
    is a type of birth control that is designed to be taken orally by women. 
	They were first approved for contraceptive use in the United States in 1960, and are a very popular form of birth control. 
	The popularity of the pill has remained high, with rates of use in the past 30 years in the United States ranging from 
	one-quarter to almost one-third of women using contraception. 
	By lowering the incidence of early fertility, unconstrained access to the 
	pill increased the enrollment rate of college-age women. 
	Studies also suggest male college completion might also have been constrained 
	by unplanned early pregnancy. 
	The fraction of U.S. college graduate women entering professional 
	programs increased substantially just after 1970, and the age at first 
	marriage among all U.S. college graduate women began to soar around the same year.
