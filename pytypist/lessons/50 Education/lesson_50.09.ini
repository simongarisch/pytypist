content = Barbed wire's singular purpose - to keep in and to keep out - 
    was first put to use on the Great Plains of the American West in the late 19th century 
	to restrict cattle and, implicitly, to secure territory by expansionist settlers and demarcate possessions. 
	Barbed wire's utilization in this rural economy led to hostility amongst the settlers themselves 
	(the short-lived Range Wars, 1883-1884), and also to tension between the settlers and Native Americans - 
	the latter of whom saw their open ranges dissected by barbed wire. 
	Barbed wire's transformation from this mixed economy into the mechanized landscape of modern warfare 
	would transform its symbolic meanings forever while still retaining its original purpose to "keep in and keep out". 
    Widely used for the first time in South Africa by the British General Horatio Herbert Kitchener against the Boers of the Transvaal 
	and the Orange Free State (in the so-called Second Boer War, 11 October-31 May 1902), 
	it was Lord Kitchener who turned to a strategy of barbed wire and blockhouses that paralleled his other initiative, 
	also involving barbed wire; the construction of what soon came to be called "concentration camps". 
	The scale and complexity of trench fortifications in the so-called Great War (stretching for nearly 1,300 miles), however, 
	were unprecedented; and it was this that allowed barbed wire to play out its new and frightening role. 
	Some of the reasons that Barbed Wire was so deadly was that it was almost indestructible but also cheap and can be mass-produced; 
	Artillery would only leave a worse mess of Barbed Wire and bolt cutters would take a long time to cut a gap through. 
	Barbed wire was mainly used to slow down the enemy so that trenches wouldn't be overrun with large hordes of infantry. 
	It also aided in funneling enemy soldiers into "kill zones" where machine guns were set up. 
	Barbed wire was a major reason Britain and France created the forefathers of the tanks we know today to break through the deadlock of trenches and barbed wire. 
	Published in 1929 in English as All Quiet on the Western Front, Remarque writes: "We recognise the distorted faces and the flattened helmets - it's the French... 
	the body falls away completely and only the shot-off hands and the stumps of the arms are left hanging in the wire." 
	Another firsthand account from a German machine gunner at the Somme said - 
	Hundreds of dead, many of the 37th Brigade, were strung out like wreckage washed up to a high-water mark. 
	Quite as many died on the enemy wire as on the ground, like fish caught in the net. 
	They hung there in grotesque postures. Some looked as though they were praying; 
	they had died on their knees and the wire had prevented their fall. From the way the dead were equally spread out, 
	whether on the wire or lying in front of it, it was clear that there were no gaps in the wire at the time of the attack.
