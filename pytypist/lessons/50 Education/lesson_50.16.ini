content = Charles Robert Darwin, (12 February 1809 - 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, 
    best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. 
	His proposition that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors is now widely accepted, 
	and considered a foundational concept in science. 
	He introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, 
	in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. 
	Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and he was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey. 
	Darwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the University of Edinburgh; 
	instead, he helped to investigate marine invertebrates. 
	Studies at the University of Cambridge (Christ's College) encouraged his passion for natural science. 
	His five-year voyage on HMS Beagle established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported Charles Lyell's 
	conception of gradual geological change, and publication of his journal of the voyage made him famous as a popular author.
