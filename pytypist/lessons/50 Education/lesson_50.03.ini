content = The number of nuclear weapons in the world has declined significantly since the Cold War: 
    down from a peak of approximately 70,300 in 1986 to an estimated 13,890 in early 2019. 
	Government officials often portray that accomplishment as a result of current or recent arms control agreements, 
	but the overwhelming portion of the reduction happened in the 1990s. 
	Approximately 93 percent of all nuclear warheads are owned by Russia and the United States. 
	Globally, the number of nuclear weapons is declining, but the pace of reduction is slowing compared with the past 25 years. 
	The United States, Russia, and the United Kingdom are reducing their overall warhead inventories, 
	France and Israel have relatively stable inventories, 
	while China, Pakistan, India, and North Korea are increasing their warhead inventories.
