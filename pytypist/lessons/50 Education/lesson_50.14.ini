content = Nikola Tesla (10 July 1856 - 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, 
    mechanical engineer, and futurist who is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern 
	alternating current (AC) electricity supply system. 
	Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, 
	and it is the form of electrical energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, 
	televisions, fans and electric lamps into a wall socket. 
	Tesla read many works, memorizing complete books, and supposedly possessed a photographic memory. 
	He was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin. 
	Tesla claimed never to sleep more than two hours per night. However, he did admit to "dozing" from time to time "to recharge his batteries". 
	Tesla worked every day from 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. or later, with dinner from exactly 8:10 p.m. 
	He dined alone, except on the rare occasions when he would give a dinner to a group to meet his social obligations. 
	Tesla would then resume his work, often until 3:00 a.m. 
	Tesla obtained around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions.
