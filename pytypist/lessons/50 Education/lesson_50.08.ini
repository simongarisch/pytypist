content = World War 1, also known as the First World War, the Great War, the Seminal Catastrophe, and initially in North America as the European War, 
    was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. 
    Contemporaneously described as "the war to end all wars", it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel, 
    including 60 million Europeans, making it one of the largest wars in history. 
    It is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history, with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war. 
	Military tactics developed before World War I failed to keep pace with advances in technology and had become obsolete. 
	These advances had allowed the creation of strong defensive systems, 
	which out-of-date military tactics could not break through for most of the war. 
	Barbed wire was a significant hindrance to massed infantry advances, while artillery, vastly more lethal than in the 1870s, 
	coupled with machine guns, made crossing open ground extremely difficult. 
	Commanders on both sides failed to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without heavy casualties. 
	In time, however, technology began to produce new offensive weapons, such as gas warfare and the tank. 
	Poison gas became one of the most-feared and best-remembered horrors of the war. 
	Throughout 1915-17, the British Empire and France suffered more casualties than Germany, 
	because of both the strategic and tactical stances chosen by the sides. 
	Strategically, while the Germans mounted only one major offensive, the Allies made several attempts to break through the German lines.
