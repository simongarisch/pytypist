content = Alan Mathison Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, 
    cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist. 
	Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. 
	Despite these accomplishments, he was not fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime, 
	due to his homosexuality, and because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act. 
	Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, 
	including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war. Due to the problems of counterfactual history, 
	it's hard to estimate what effect Ultra intelligence had on the war,
	but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14 million lives. 
	Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts; the Labouchere Amendment of 1885 had mandated that "gross indecency" was a criminal offence in the UK. 
	He accepted chemical castration treatment, with DES, as an alternative to prison. 
	Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. 
	An inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. 
	In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the 
	British government for "the appalling way he was treated". 
	On 15 July 2019 the Bank of England announced that Turing would be depicted on the United Kingdom's new 50 pound note.
