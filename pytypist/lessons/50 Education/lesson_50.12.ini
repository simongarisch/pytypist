content = Jonas Edward Salk was an American medical researcher and virologist. 
    He discovered and developed one of the first successful polio vaccines. 
	Born in New York City, he attended the City College of New York and New York University School of Medicine, 
	later choosing to do medical research instead of becoming a practicing physician. 
	Salk saw an opportunity to extend this project towards developing a vaccine against polio, 
	and, together with the skilled research team he assembled, 
	devoted himself to this work for the next seven years. 
	The field trial set up to test the Salk vaccine was, according to O'Neill, 
	"the most elaborate program of its kind in history, involving 20,000 physicians and public health officers, 
	64,000 school personnel, and 220,000 volunteers." 
	Over 1.8 million school children took part in the trial. 
	When news of the vaccine's success was made public on April 12, 1955, Salk was hailed as a "miracle worker" 
	and the day almost became a national holiday. 
	Around the world, an immediate rush to vaccinate began, with countries including Canada, 
	Sweden, Denmark, Norway, West Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Belgium planning 
	to begin polio immunization campaigns using Salk's vaccine. 
	Salk campaigned for mandatory vaccination, claiming that public health should be considered a "moral commitment."
