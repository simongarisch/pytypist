content = The Black Death, also known as the Great Plague or the Plague was one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, 
    resulting in the deaths of an estimated 75 to 200 million people in Eurasia and peaking in Europe from 1347 to 1351. 
	The Black Death is estimated to have killed 30%% to 60%% of Europe's population. 
	It took 200 years for the world population to recover to its previous level. 
	It is thought that the plague disease was commonly present in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents. 
	Contemporary accounts of the plague are often varied or imprecise. 
	The most commonly noted symptom was the appearance of buboes in the groin, the neck and armpits.
	This was followed by acute fever and vomiting of blood. Most victims died two to seven days after initial infection. 
	Freckle-like spots and rashes,which could have been caused by flea-bites, were identified as another potential sign of the plague.
