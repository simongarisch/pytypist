content = The 1918 influenza pandemic (January 1918 - December 1920; colloquially known as Spanish flu) was an unusually deadly influenza pandemic, 
    the first of the two pandemics involving H1N1 influenza virus. 
    It infected 500 million people around the world, including people on remote Pacific islands and in the Arctic. 
    Probably 50 million, and possibly as high as 100 million (three to five percent of Earth's population at the time) died, 
    making it one of the deadliest epidemics in human history. 
    Infectious diseases already limited life expectancy in the early 20th century, 
    but life expectancy in the United States dropped by about 12 years in the first year of the pandemic. 
    Most influenza outbreaks disproportionately kill the very young and the very old, 
    with a higher survival rate for those in-between. 
    However, the Spanish flu pandemic resulted in a higher than expected mortality rate for young adults. 
    To maintain morale, wartime censors minimized early reports of illness and mortality in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. 
    Papers were free to report the epidemic's effects in neutral Spain. 
    These stories created a false impression of Spain as especially hard hit, thereby giving rise to the pandemic's nickname, "Spanish flu".
