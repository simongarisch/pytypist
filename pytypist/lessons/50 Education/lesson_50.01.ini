content = Parents want to do everything possible to make sure their children are healthy and protected from preventable diseases. 
    Vaccination is the best way to do that. 
	Though vaccination has led to a dramatic decline in the number of U.S. cases of several infectious diseases, 
	some of these diseases are quite common in other countries and are brought to the U.S. by international travelers. 
	If children are not vaccinated, they could easily get one of these diseases from a traveler or while traveling themselves. 
	Outbreaks of preventable diseases occur when many parents decide not to vaccinate their children. 
	Vaccination is safe and effective. 
	All vaccines undergo long and careful review by scientists, doctors, and the federal government to make sure they are safe.
