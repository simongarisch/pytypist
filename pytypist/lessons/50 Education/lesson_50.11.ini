content = On 11 January 1922 insulin was first used in the treatment of diabetes. 
    Insulin was discovered by Sir Frederick G Banting, Charles H Best and JJR Macleod at the University of Toronto in 1921 
	and it was subsequently purified by James B Collip.
	Before 1921, it was exceptional for people with Type 1 diabetes to live more than a year or two. 
	One of the twentieth century's greatest medical discoveries, 
	it remains the only effective treatment for people with Type 1 diabetes today. 
	Children dying from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were kept in large wards, 
	often with 50 or more patients in a ward, mostly comatose. 
	Grieving family members were often in attendance, awaiting the (until then, inevitable) death. 
	In one of medicine's more dramatic moments Banting, Best, and Collip went from bed to bed, 
	injecting an entire ward with the new purified extract. 
	Before they had reached the last dying child, 
	the first few were awakening from their coma, 
	to the joyous exclamations of their families.
