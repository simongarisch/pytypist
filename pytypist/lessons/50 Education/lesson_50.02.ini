content = The Gulag, acronym of Main Administration of Camps, 
    was the government agency in charge of the Soviet forced labour camp system 
	which incarcerated about 18 million people throughout their history, 
	operated from the 1920s until shortly after Stalin's death in 1953. 
	The tentative historical consensus among archival researchers and historians who utilize such data 
	is that of the 18 million people who passed through the gulag 
	between 1.5 and 1.7 million perished as a result of their detention though some historians believe 
	the actual death toll is somewhat higher. 
	The camps housed a wide range of convicts, from petty criminals to political prisoners. 
	Large numbers were convicted by simplified procedures, 
	such as by NKVD troikas or by other instruments of extrajudicial punishment. 
	The Gulag is recognized by many as a major instrument of political repression in the Soviet Union.
