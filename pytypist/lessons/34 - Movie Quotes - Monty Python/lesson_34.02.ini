content = We would like to apologize for the way in which politicians 
    are represented in this programme. It was never our intention to 
	imply that politicians are weak-kneed, political time-servers who 
	are more concerned with their personal vendettas and private power 
	struggles than the problems of government. 
	Nor to suggest at any point that they sacrifice their credibility 
	by denying free debate on vital matters in the mistaken impression 
	that party unity comes before the well-being of the people they supposedly represent. 
	Nor to imply at any stage that they are squabbling little toadies 
	without an ounce of concern for the vital social problems of today. 
	Nor indeed do we intend that viewers should consider them as crabby, 
	ulcerous, little self-seeking vermin with furry legs and an excessive 
	addiction to alcohol and certain explicit sexual practices which some 
	people might find offensive. We are sorry if this impression has come across.
