content = Well, er, yes Mr. Anchovy, but you see your report here says 
    that you are an extremely dull person. You see, our experts describe

	spineless, easily dominated, no sense of humour, tedious company and 
	irrepressibly drab and awful. And whereas in most professions these would 
	be considerable drawbacks, in chartered accountancy, they're a positive boon.
