content = I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia
    sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave-owners 
    will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. 
	I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, 
	a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, 
	sweltering with the heat of oppression, 
	will be transormed into an oasis of freedom and justice. 
	I have a dream that my four little children will one day
    live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color
    of their skin but by the content of their character. 
    I have a dream ... I have a dream that one day in Alabama,
    with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips
    dripping with the words of interposition and nullification,
    one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black
    girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and
    white girls as sisters and brothers.
