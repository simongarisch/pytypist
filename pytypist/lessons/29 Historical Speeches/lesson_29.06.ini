content = When I consider the magnitude of the subject 
    which I am to bring before the House-a subject, 
	in which the interests, not of this country, 
	nor of Europe alone, but of the whole world, 
	and of posterity, are involved: and when I think, 
	at the same time, on the weakness of the advocate 
	who has undertaken this great cause-when these 
	reflections press upon my mind, it is impossible 
	for me not to feel both terrified and concerned 
	at my own inadequacy to such a task. But when I reflect, 
	however, on the encouragement which I have had, 
	through the whole course of a long and laborious 
	examination of this question, and how much candour 
	I have experienced, and how conviction has increased 
	within my own mind, in proportion as I have advanced 
	in my labours; when I reflect, especially, that 
	however averse any gentleman may now be, yet we 
	shall all be of one opinion in the end; when I turn 
	myself to these thoughts, I take courage - I determine 
	to forget all my other fears, and I march forward 
	with a firmer step in the full assurance that my 
	cause will bear me out, and that I shall be able 
	to justify upon the clearest principles, 
	every resolution in my hand, the avowed end of which is, 
	the total abolition of the slave trade.
